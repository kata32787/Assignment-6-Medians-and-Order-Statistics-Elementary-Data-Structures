Selection Algorithms: Implementation and Analysis

Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of two selection algorithms:

Deterministic Median of Medians Algorithm

Randomized Quickselect Algorithm

These algorithms are used to find the  smallest element in an array. The repository includes Python implementations, performance analysis, and empirical comparisons.

Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. You can check your Python version by running:

python --version

Clone the Repository


Run the Algorithms

Deterministic Selection

python deterministic_selection.py

Randomized Selection

python randomized_selection.py

Run Tests

To verify the correctness of the implementations:

python test_selection.py

Performance Analysis

The algorithms were tested with different input sizes (1,000 to 100,000 elements). Results are summarized in the report (report.pdf).
